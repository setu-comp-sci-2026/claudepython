= The Problem

So far, we can store one value at a time.

```python
student1 = "Ava"
student2 = "Ben"
student3 = "Cara"
```

#pause

This works for three students, but not for thirty.

*Collections* let us store many related values under one name.

= Python Lists as Arrays

In many languages, students first meet *arrays*.

In Python, the closest beginner-friendly equivalent is a *list*.

```python
students = ["Ava", "Ben", "Cara"]
grades = [72, 81, 65, 90]
```

#pause

A list is:
- ordered
- changeable
- indexed from 0
- able to grow and shrink

= Why This Matters

Collections are used everywhere:

- grades in a class
- items in a shopping basket
- sensor readings
- names in a booking system
- records loaded from a file

#pause

They also form the basis of later topics:

- files and JSON
- CRUD programs
- classes and objects
- data processing

= Today's Goal

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- create a list
- access items by position
- change list contents
- use strings as sequences
- slice lists and strings
- process lists using loops
